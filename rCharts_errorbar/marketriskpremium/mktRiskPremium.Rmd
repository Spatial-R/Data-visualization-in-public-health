# rCharts Error Bar of Equity Risk Premium Survey

```{r echo = F, message = F, warning = F, error = F, cache = F}
require(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(results='asis', message = F, warning = F, error = T, cache = F, tidy = F)
```

One of my favorite surveys from academic research on finance is an international survey on market risk premium run by the [IESE Business School at the University of Navarra](http://www.iese.edu/).  Even though I look at it occasionally every year, I never noticed the error bar plot.

This looks remarkably similar to a custom error bar d3 plot that I implemented for [rCharts](http://rcharts.io).  I guess there are a few of these in the wild.  See [Long Winding Road Marked with Error Bars and Tweets](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2013/09/long-winding-road-marked-with-error.html) for one example and this [NY Times Article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/sports/football/turning-advanced-statistics-into-fantasy-football-analysis.html?ref=football&_r=0) for another.

I just could not resist making this error bar plot of market risk premium interactive.

### Data
All data came from this [fine article](http://ssrn.com/abstract=91416), so attribution and credit should be entirely directed there.
<address style="font-size:70%;"><strong>Market Risk Premium and Risk Free Rate Used for 51 Countries in 2013</strong>

I did a little copy/paste magic from pdf into Excel and then saved it as a .csv file.  With R, we will read it with the following line of code.

```{r}
# data source: http://ssrn.com/abstract=91416
mrp <- read.csv("ssrn-id914160.csv",stringsAsFactors=F)
```


### Interactive Error Bar with d3 and rCharts

This is still just a sketch, but I think it offers a very good proof of concept.

```{r results='asis'}
## using very experimental version of rCharts
## require(devtools)
## install_github("rCharts", "timelyportfolio", ref = "test-speedimprove")
require(rCharts)

#set working directory to a local and change setLib and templates$script
#if going to github gh-pages repo not desired
#path = "http://timelyportfolio.github.io/rCharts_errorbar"
path = ".."
ePlot <- rCharts$new()
ePlot$setLib(path)

ePlot$templates$script = paste0(path,"/layouts/chart.html")
#not the way Ramnath intended but we'll hack away
ePlot$params =  list(
  data = subset(mrp,variable=="mrp"),
  height = 500,
  width = 900,
  margin = list(top = 10, bottom = 10, right = 50, left = 100),
  x = "Country",
  y = "mean",
  radius = 3,
  sort = list( var = "mean" ),
  whiskers = "#!function(d){return [d.mean - 1.96 * d.sd, d.mean + 1.96 * d.sd]}!#",
  tooltipLabels = c("Country","mean","sd") 
)
ePlot
```

```{r results='asis'}
#example of facetting
ePlotFacet <- rCharts$new()
ePlotFacet$setLib(path)
ePlotFacet$templates$script = paste0(path,"/layouts/chart.html")
ePlotFacet$params =   list(
  data = mrp,
  height = 500,
  width = 900,
  margin = list(top = 10, bottom = 10, right = 50, left = 100),
  x = "Country",
  y = "mean",
  color = "Country",
  radius = 4,
  sort = list( var = "mean" ),
  whiskers = "#!function(d){return [d.mean - 1.96 * d.sd, d.mean + 1.96 * d.sd]}!#",
  tooltipLabels = c("Country","variable","mean","sd"),
  facet = list(y = "variable")  #add y for facet grid
)
ePlotFacet
```
